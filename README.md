# usb_2.0_protocol
Code files of my BTP 

The folder consists of all code files that I have used to implement Universal Serial Bus 2.0 protocol in VHDL.
All the test benches for the design codes have "_tb" at the end.

The top level block of the design is present in _usb.vhd_ file. 
The _usb.vhd_ consists of transmitter, receiver, controller, dummy host and tristate components in it. 
The test bench for _usb.vhd_ is present in **usb_tb.vhd** file.
